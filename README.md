# LNHM Plant Health Monitoring | Group Project

## Summary

Liverpool Natural History Museum has an array of sensors setup to monitor the health of a plant, configured with a single API endpoint that reports the current health of a plant.
The outcome is for the museum to be able to monitor the health of the plants over time and to be able to alert the gardeners when there is a problem.
The data will need to be stored in long term storage, and be queryable to create visualisations and alerts.

## Deliverables

- A full data pipeline, hosted in the cloud
- A short-term database solution that can store the full data for the past 24 hours
- A long-term archive solution for data older than 24 hours
- A form of visualisation for the data
